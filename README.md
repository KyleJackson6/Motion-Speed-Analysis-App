# 🎥 Motion Speed Analyzer

A Streamlit app for analyzing motion speed in videos using Optical Flow and OpenCV.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload `.mp4` videos via browser interface
- Preprocessing with Gaussian blur
- Background removal using MOG2 subtractor
- Optical flow visualization with Farneback algorithm
- Frame sliders for interactive viewing
- Line graph showing average motion speed per frame
- Download button for saving the processed video
